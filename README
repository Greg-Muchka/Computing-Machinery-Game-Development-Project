The purpose of this assignment was to gain experience coding while interacting hardware interfaces. This included writing 
multiple moduls for drawing to the screen, writing interupts for mouse and keyboard interactions,sound and more. The knowledge gained from 
this assignment showed me a technical side of low level machinery as well allowed me to collaberate with a partner on a large assingment.
